# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The data surrounding the crowdfunding is being broken down and analyzed.
### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to draw conclusions from our analysis to determine the success of the crowdfunding and the reasons behind the success.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The Theater Outcomes based on Launch date chart shows that the months of May, June and July were the most successful in the crowdfunding campaign. Adittionally it shows that in all months the campaign had more successful outcomes then failed outcomes, except in the month of December, which showed a relatively even number of successful and failed outcomes. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The Outcomes Based on Goals chart showed that up until the goal range of $15,000 to $19,999, the campaign was more successful., but then as the goal got higher, the campaign had more failed outcomes. That is until we saw a reversal of this trend when the goal was between $35,000 to $45,000. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I did not encouter any challenges, however, I think explaining the the reversal of the trend in the "Outcomes Based on Goals" chart is something that you'd want to look into as you'd like to know the reasoning so the sucess at higher goals could be replicated.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The most successful months were May, June and July. The least successful month was December.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
It looks like the lower the goal, the better chance there is of success, but as mentioned, we had a reversal of this trend that needs to reviewed to confirm.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There is no background provided on the staff pick and spotlight columns, although we can assume what they mean. Additionally, I have no context as to why any campaigns were cancelled as opposed to running them through to the "deadline date". 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We did it through the module, but the Parent Categories, helps tell a story of where the campaigns were more sucessful and therefore those areas can be targeted again. Also, doing some analysis based on the "Spotlight" column to determine if putting something in the spotlight helped to make the campaign more successful.
